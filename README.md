## Loan Eligibility Prediction: Preprocessing & Model Training

# Overview
This project focuses on applying data preprocessing techniques to train machine learning models for loan eligibility prediction. The dataset consists of customer attributes such as gender, marital status, education, income, loan amount, and credit history. The goal is to clean and preprocess the data before training predictive models and analyzing their performance.

# Objective
The primary objective is to build an efficient machine learning pipeline that prepares raw data, applies necessary transformations, and trains models to predict loan approval status. The project also evaluates different preprocessing techniques and their impact on model performance.

## Technologies Used
- Python for data processing and model training
- Pandas & NumPy for data manipulation
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for exploratory data analysis
- Scikit-Learn for model development and evaluation
## Key Insights
Data preprocessing plays a crucial role in improving model accuracy.
Feature engineering, handling missing values, and encoding categorical data impact predictive performance.
Model evaluation helps identify the most suitable approach for loan approval prediction.
